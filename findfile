# search_file.sh
# This script searches the entire filesystem, starting from the root (/),
# for a file whose name matches the first command-line argument.
# Usage: ./search_file.sh <filename_to_find>

# --- Argument Validation ---
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide a filename to search for."
    echo "Usage: ./search_file.sh <filename_to_find>"
    exit 1

# Store the search term, adding quotes to handle potential special characters
# or spaces in the filename, though 'find' handles $1 quoted internally too.
FILENAME="$1"

echo "Searching the entire system for files named '$FILENAME'..."
echo "Note: Output may take some time. Permission errors are suppressed."
echo "--------------------------------------------------------"

# --- Main Search Logic ---
# 1. 'find /': Starts the search from the root directory.
# 2. '-type f': Ensures only files (not directories or links) are matched.
# 3. '-name "$FILENAME"': Matches the name exactly.
# 4. '2>/dev/null': Redirects standard error (2) to /dev/null,
#    which suppresses the "Permission denied" messages you often get
#    when traversing protected system directories as a non-root user.
find / -type f -name "$FILENAME" 2>/dev/null
